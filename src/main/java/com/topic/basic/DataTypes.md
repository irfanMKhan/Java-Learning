## Java is Pass by Value, Not Pass by Reference

+ Pass by value:
```
The method parameter values are copied to another variable 
and then the copied object is passed to the method. The method uses the copy.
```

+ Pass by reference:
``` 
An alias or reference to the actual parameter is passed to the method. 
The method accesses the actual parameter.
```

Java has two data types: `primitive and reference (also known as non-primitive).`


## Primitive Types: 

```
Java primitive types are the simplest and most basic data types in Java. 
They represent raw values such as numbers and characters. 
The most frequently used primitive data types are 
- int (integers), 
- boolean (boolean values), and
- char (characters).
```

#### Integer:
can accommodate whole number ranges `From -2,147,483,648 To 2,147,483,647.`

`int` is primitive type while `Integer` is a wrapper class which gives more flexibility 
such as storing, converting and manipulating an `int` data.
