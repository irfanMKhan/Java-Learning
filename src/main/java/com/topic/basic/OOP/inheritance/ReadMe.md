In Java, an interface is a blueprint for a class. It is a collection of abstract methods (methods without bodies) 
and static or default methods. A class implements an interface by providing concrete implementations for 
its abstract methods. Interfaces support multiple inheritance in Java, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.

Key Features of Interfaces in Java:

Abstract Methods: All methods in an interface are abstract by default 
(until Java 8, where default and static methods were introduced).
Fields: Fields in interfaces are public, static, and final by default.
Implementation: Classes or other interfaces can implement or extend an interface 
using the implements or extends keyword.
Multiple Inheritance: A class can implement multiple interfaces, addressing the 
limitations of multiple inheritance with classes.

Positive Aspects of Interfaces:
Code Reusability: Promotes reusability by defining standard contracts that can be implemented by different classes.

Multiple Inheritance: Supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to derive from multiple sources without ambiguity.

Loose Coupling: Decouples the implementation from the definition, promoting flexibility and scalability.

Polymorphism: Enables polymorphism, where different implementations can be referred to using a common interface type.

Flexibility: Default and static methods (from Java 8 onwards) allow adding 
new functionalities to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

Shortcomings of Interfaces:
Implementation Burden: Classes must provide implementations for all abstract methods, which 
can become cumbersome for interfaces with many methods.

No State: Interfaces cannot have instance variables (beyond public static final constants), 
limiting their ability to encapsulate state.

Performance Overhead: Method calls on interfaces may involve a slight runtime overhead compared 
to direct class method calls (though often negligible).

Limited Backward Compatibility: Adding methods to an interface without default implementations 
breaks existing implementing classes (pre-Java 8 issue).

Complexity: Excessive use of interfaces for minor variations can lead to complexity and overengineering.
